        <h3>HoloHand Museum Guide</h3>
        <p>
          Museum Dr. Guislain in Ghent is looking for a digital product
          (application) that enhances, improves, and/or supports the museum
          experience. The goal is to identify existing pain points within the
          museum and devise a unique digital solution for them. The challenge is
          to brainstorm various solutions and create a concept, which does not
          necessarily need to be feasible.
        </p>
        <h5>The Solution</h5>
        <p>
          Let yourself be guided through the museum by Dr. Guislain himself, a
          small hologram on your arm connected to an application on your
          smartphone. With the app, you can fully immerse yourself in the
          history and environment through augmented reality. You can also
          receive more information about what you see or relive your personal
          visit afterward.
